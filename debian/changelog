  * Finally remove 21-export-quicktime_set_window.patch.
    This patch was added in libquicktime_0.9.3-2 in 2004 in order to fix
    building xmovie. This package, in turn, had this fix integrated into
    its final 1.9.12-1.1 package in 2006 and has since then been removed
    from Debian.
    Technically, we have already bumped SONAME anyway, we are the only
    distro to ship this symbol, no other known package needs it and we
    are targetting experimental anyway. Should be save. ;)
  * Remove myself from uploaders.

    version.

    debian/ directory which is (a) trivial and (b) now documented in
